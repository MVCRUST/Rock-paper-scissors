## Gameplay

**The terminal edition**

To play the Rock, Paper, Scissors game within your browser make sure to run `node inline.js`, and this will bring up a prompt asking for 'Rock', 'Paper' or 'Scissors'. This should look like this if successful:

Once you type in your response, the machine will throw in theres and the winner will be rewarded with a point! First to three will win the game. To play again just run the command again.

**The Browser edition**

To play the rock, paper, scissors game with a clean aesthetic on the browser, right-click index.html and select 'open with live server'.
This will take you to a screen which looks like this:

This page lets you chose either Rock, Paper, or Scissors and after you hit 'ENTER' compare with what the computer got. Like before, the first to three will win so choose carefully.
